# WoltBackEndAssignment2020

## Instructions
This guide assumes that the reader has the latest version of NodeJs installed. According to the job advertisement, React is really popular at Wolt so I don't think that is an issue, but just in case the reader can get NodeJs [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). After installing node, reader can get the project running by following these simple steps.

1. In the command line, navigate to the root of this project.
2. At the root, run command `npm install`
3. Run command `npm start`
4. Server is now open at http://localhost:3001/ . Queries to the back end can be made for example like this:
http://localhost:3001/restaurants/search?q=sushi&lat=60.17045&lon=24.93147
